# Future personal website

## Currently a work in progress
File structure borrowed from the Dragonfly project. `package.json` will likely be the same, but otherwise, all other files will be removed and replaced with relevant files. Current setup is a React FrontEnd with no backend. A skeleton file structure is in place.
